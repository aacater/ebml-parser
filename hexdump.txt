Here's the first 24 bytes from the mkv file we have been using to test with.

-- [0x1A][0x45][0xDF][0xA3] are the file signature for mkv files
0x1A
0x45
0xDF
0xA3

0x93

-- [0x42][0x82] is the identifier for the DocType of the file
0x42

This is mostly just a submission so that we have something to show for now, but we have been basing a fair bit of our code off of an EBML parser we found online. We plan to rewrite as much of this parser as we can understand, but we have the hex identifiers for the various pieces of the metadata and our plan is to write a parser for these various parts.
